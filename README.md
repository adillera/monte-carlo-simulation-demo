### Monte Carlo Simulation Demo

This demo makes use of the team data which includes the throughput and hotfixes that enters the system and generates a CSV file that contains the forecast date of delivery depending on the number of tickets to deliver.

The idea is that the hotfixes that enters the board distracts people from finishing their task and that it should be viewed as a limiter on the amount of ticket that can be normally produced to give a better simulation on the randomness of bugs (or hotfixes) that will be encountered in the system.

Eventually the team data (and hotfixes) would be big enough that it would warrant it's own CSV file but that would be for expansion in a later date.
